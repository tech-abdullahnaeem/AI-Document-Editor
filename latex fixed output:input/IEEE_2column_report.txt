🔒 LOCKING IMAGE POSITIONS
----------------------------------------
   ✅ Applied [!htbp] positioning to 6 images
   📌 Images will stay closer: here, top, bottom, or page

📏 LIMITING IMAGE SIZES
----------------------------------------
   ✅ Limited 6 images to maximum 0.5 (50%) width
   📐 Smaller images help prevent floating to document end
