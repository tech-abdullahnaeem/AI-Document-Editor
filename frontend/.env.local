# API Base URL - Backend API endpoint
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000

# Optional: Override for production deployment
# VITE_API_BASE=https://your-production-api.com

# Note: Sensitive API keys (Gemini, MathPix) are managed by the backend
# The frontend does NOT need direct access to these keys
# All API calls go through the backend API gateway
